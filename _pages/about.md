## About the Chapter

The GRSS UNICAMP Student Chapter is a group composed of geology and geography students sponsored by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society.

Founded in 2010, the chapter aims to promote and support activities related to remote sensing and geoprocessing, as well as the dissemination of new technologies and information services.

The chapter is based at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil, and actively promotes academic integration, technical training, and scientific outreach.
