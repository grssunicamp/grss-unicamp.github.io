## About the Chapter

The IEEE GRSS UNICAMP Student Chapter is composed of undergraduate and graduate students from geology and geography programs at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and is sponsored by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS).

Founded in 2010, the chapter aims to promote and support academic, scientific, and technical activities related to remote sensing and geoprocessing. Its mission includes the dissemination of new technologies, methodologies, and information services, as well as fostering interdisciplinary collaboration among students and researchers.

Based at UNICAMP, the chapter actively contributes to scientific outreach, technical training, and the integration of students into the international geosciences and remote sensing community.
