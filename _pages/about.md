  <h2>About the Chapter</h2>

  <p>
    The IEEE GRSS UNICAMP Student Chapter is composed of undergraduate and graduate students
    from geology and geography programs at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and is sponsored
    by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS).
  </p>

  <p>
    Founded in 2010, the chapter aims to promote and support academic, scientific, and technical
    activities related to remote sensing and geoprocessing. Its mission includes the dissemination
    of new technologies, methodologies, and information services, as well as fostering
    interdisciplinary collaboration among students and researchers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based at UNICAMP, the chapter actively contributes to scientific outreach, technical training,
    and the integration of students into the international geosciences and remote sensing community.
